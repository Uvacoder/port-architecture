            <p>A RESTful web app that allows business users to send feedback-surveys to their clients (on their product,
                provided services ect.), featuring
                OAuth, payments and emailing. The front-end is written in React.js, using React-router, Redux,
                Redux-form. The back-end is
                written in JavaScript, hosted in Node.js and implemented with Express library. MongoDB Atlas is used as
                a cloud database, implemented with Mongoose library.</p>

            <p style="text-indent: 0;"><span class="drop-cap-web">Landing</span>The Landing page contains a header
                component and a carousel. The carousel items hold basic usage instructions. The header holds a login
                option via Google. User authentication is performed with Google OAuth and passport library, when the
                user is redirected to Google to insert their user account and password. Once idetified by Google, the
                user is routed back to the api server. Their account details are stored as new user record in MongoDB,
                and they're routed to the app's Dashboard component. If the user already exists in the database (a
                cookie is sent to the user's browser to verify that), they're routed to the app's Dashboard component,
                where their personal data is fetched and displayed.</p>

                list of all former surveys sent by the users. If no surveys were sent, the dashboard displays the option
                to create and send a new survey. In order to fill out a new feedback survey, the user is asked to pay
                for sending credits. Payment is implemented with Stripe service. Pressing on the <i>add credits</i>
                button pops up a new window with the Stripe payment form. Once the user has entered the payment details,
                a token is received from Stripe and sent to the app's api (via a POST request). The user's number of
                credits is then updated in the database.</p>

            <p style="text-indent: 0;"><span class="drop-cap-web">New Survey</span>Clicking the <i>add</i> button
                reroutes the user to the New Survey component, where they can fill out a form (created with Redux Form).
                The required inputs are the survey title, the email subject line and the survey question (to be featured
                in the email body) and a list of email recipients. Clicking the <i>next</i> button performs a validation
                of the input fields. Once validation is complete the Form Review component is rendered, displaying the
                filled-out form to be confirmed before submitting. The user has an option to go <i>back</i> and edit the
                form, or click <i>send survey</i> to email the list of recipients with the survey.</p>
            <p>Once a survey is sent, a POST request is sent to the api server with the form inputs. These are recorded
                to the database and associated with the user. The user is then rerouted to the Dashboard. The sending of
                the emails is performed by Sendgrid. Sendgrid allows the creation of an email template and
                click-tracking via a webhook. The email recipient can respond to the survey by clicking one of five
                options. After clicking, the recipient is redirected to a Thankyou page. That page's URL contains the
                survey's unique id and their response. Using Sendgrid's webhook, the recipient's response is recorded to
                the database.</p>

                displayed on the Dashboard component. Each survey is represented by a Survey Card component that
                contains the survey title, its content, the date it was sent on, and the date it was last responded to.
                A pie chart (created with React chart and charts.js) displays the distribution of responses, and the
                total number of responses receives the color of the most frequent response type. Clicking the
                <i>trash</i> icon pops-up a modal with the option to delete the current survey. Once <i>delete</i> is
                clicked the survey record is deleted from the database.</p>
