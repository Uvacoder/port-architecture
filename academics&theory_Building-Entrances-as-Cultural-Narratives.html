            <p>Tel Aviv was first founded as a modern suburban neighborhood in the outskirts of 3000-year-old Jaffa. The
                new housing estate was founded by Jewish residents of Jaffa, who first named it Ahuzat Bayit, meaning
                “homestead” in Hebrew. Their goal was to establish a Hebrew urban center, in the model of a garden city.
                The purchased land was divided into 60 plots, and within a year the first 66 houses were built. Along
                the main street all houses had a front yard surrounded by a fence, a porch and 3-4 steps elevated the
                houses from the ground, according to European custom.</p>

                coming down to street level</p>
            <p>Following the 1920’s riots between the Jewish and Arab populations in Jaffa, Ahuzat Bayit – now named
                Tel-Aviv – was further developed as an alternative Jewish financial and commercial center. Little by
                little, the ground level of the houses gave way to small businesses. The fences were taken down, and in
                some cases even the porches and stairs were dismantled, so the ground floor was lowered to street level.
                The relatively small window openings were widened to allow a commercial façade. By the 1930’s the
                commercial surge left no corner unused, when the spaces between the houses and even stairways were
                filled by kiosks, locksmiths and jewelers.</p>

                buildings on columns</p>
            <p>During the 1930’s and 40’s there was an immigration wave of Jews who fled Europe to Palestine. After the
                closing of the Bauhaus School by the Nazis in 1933, many of its Jewish graduates thus arrived at Tel
                Aviv. These unique historical circumstances resulted in the flourishing of the international style which
                accommodates most of the urban fabric of central Tel Aviv, named as the “White City”. The urban layout
                of the city was planned in the model of a garden city by Patrick Geddes (1927), and over the course of
                20 years it was filled by over four thousand buildings in the Bauhaus/International Style, inhabited by
                bourgeois residents. Adopting Le-Corbusier’s principals, the ground floor of the white elegant buildings
                gave way to slender columns, stylish lobbies and foyers, and groomed gardens.</p>

                dilemmas</p>
            <p>Over the years the historic core of the city had been neglected, yet the UNESCO declaration of the white
                city as a world heritage site (2003) was a game changer. The city and its people identified the
                cultural, touristic and financial potential of the white city, thus began a conservation surge of the
                historic urban fabric. A municipal conservation plan was approved only in 2008, raising a well disputed
                conservation dilemma – which architectural stage is the most important to restore? Should façades be
                restored to their original state, or is the story of the city more important than the original
                architectural intent? Or in other words – is a locksmith housing an old stairway more relevant to the
                city’s narrative than the stairway itself? (See Amnon Bar or, <span style="font-style: italic;">A Time

            <p>Another dilemma presented to the city planners and conservers is the change in the socio-economic climate
                which manifested in the erection of high-rise buildings within the old garden city. Wishing to maintain
                the city center as the Israel’s primary financial district, private entrepreneurs were allowed to erect
                sky-scrapers amongst the historic buildings, with the obligation to conserve them and allow spaces on
                the street level open for public use. While the outcome is debatable, it has undoubtedly changed the
                nature of the ground floor – what was once a neighborly front porch has now become a curtain-wall
