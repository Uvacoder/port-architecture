        <div class="abstract">
            <p>This paper offers a few reflections on Jacques Lacan’s Mirror Phase in relation to the works of
                American
                artist Chuck Close.
                Over the past five decades, Close’s work has focused on large-scale
                self-portraits, and portraits of the artist’s friends and family. He first gained recognition with
                his hyper-realistic paintings, but gradually the photo-like portraits evolved into facial portraits
                comprised of thousands of fragments aligned to a grid. In his later works, each fragment became
                autonomous, to the extent that the portrait could only be perceived as a coherent image only from a
                distance.</p>
            <p>The experience of looking at the enlarged portraits, with their direct gaze at the viewer, strongly
                resonates with Jacques Lacan’s description of the <span style="font-style: italic;">Mirror
                    Phase</span>:
                the constitutive moment at which an infant first perceives their own gestalt image and becomes <span
                    style="font-style: italic;">I</span> – a subject with a sense of self. The different stages of
                Close’s work throughout the years could be regarded as an illustration sequence to the mirror stage,
                and also as representations of structured malfunctions within the symbolic system. In this paper I
                attempt to examine the dialectic manner in which Close’s works are both subjected-to and undermine
                the
                symbolic order they depict.

            <p class="article-sub">Introduction</p>
            <p style="text-indent: 0;"><span class="drop-cap">O</span>ver the past five decades, the work of
                American
                artist Chuck Close has focused on large-scale
                self-portraits, and portraits of the artist’s friends and family. Close first gained recognition
                with
                his hyper-realistic paintings, but gradually the photo-like portraits evolved into facial portraits

                autonomous, to the extent that the portrait could be perceived as a coherent image only from a
                distance.
            </p>
            <p>The experience of looking at the enlarged portraits, with their direct gaze at the viewer, strongly
                resonates with Jacques Lacan’s description of the <span style="font-style: italic;">Mirror
                    Phase</span>:
                the constitutive moment at which an
                infant first perceives their own gestalt image and becomes <span style="font-style: italic;">I</span> –
                a subject with a sense of self. The
                different stages of Close’s work throughout the years could be regarded as an illustration sequence
                to
                the mirror stage: first the face as the gestalt of the <span style="font-style: italic;">I</span>,
                then
                the constitution of the subject through
                the gaze of the other, through the illusionary fantasy of the dismembered corporal body (or of the
                face), and finally the incorporation of the subject into the socio-symbolic order.</p>
            <p>Close’s portraits could be regarded not only as illustrations but as symptoms - representations of
                structured malfunctions in the symbolic system. I ask to examine the thematic relations between
                Close’s
                work and Lacanian concepts such as the mirror stage, and to examine the dialectic manner in which
                Close’s works are both subjected-to and undermine the symbolic order they depict.</p>
            <p class="article-sub">The Face as Gestalt ׀ Imaginary Identification</p>
            <p class="article-sub" style="text-indent: 1.5em;">1. Photo-Realism as Absolute Gestalt?</p>
            <p>The Mirror-Phase is a metaphor for the formation the self. Between the ages 6-18 months, an infant
                gazes
                at the mirror for the first time and sees their reflection – a whole figure which the toddler can
                control its movements and recognize as a glorified version of themselves. The reflection is the
                gestalt
                of the infant’s ego, or as Lacan puts it “an exteriority in which his form is certainly more
                constituent
                than constituted, but in which it appears to him above all in a contrasting size that fixes it and a
                symmetry that inverts it […]”<a href="#fn1" class="endnote">[1]</a></p>
            <p>When asked about the manner in which he envisions himself as the subject of a self-portrait, Close
                admitted he sees himself as “visual information”<a href="#fn2" class="endnote">[2]</a>. Close
                suffers
                from ‘face-blindness’, or in its
                medical term – <span style="font-style: italic;">Prosopagnosia</span>, which is a cognitive-based
                inability to recognize and/or distinguish
                between different faces.<a href="#fn3" class="endnote">[3]</a> What makes it difficult for Close to
                recognize faces is their movement in three
                dimension. Any slight change in angle of facial expression are, to Close, a representation of an
                entirely different face. Art researcher Richard Shiff describes it as follows: “[…] every minor
                alteration in physical presence or emotional mood becomes so noticeable that it renders his
                recognition
                for a particular face impossible.”<a href="#fn4" class="endnote">[4]</a></p>
            <p>Prosopagnosia has had a great impact on Close’s work, and first and foremost on his technique.<a
                    href="#fn5" class="endnote">[5]</a> He describes his face-blindness in the following manner:</p>

        <div class="quote">I don’t know who anyone is and have essentially no memory at all for people in real
            space,
            but when I flatten them out in a photograph, I can commit that image to memory in a way; I have almost a
            kind of photographic memory for flat stuff.

        </div>
        <div class="article">
            <p>The first stage in creating these portraits is the photographic documentation of the subjects.
                Painting
                based on photography was typical of photo-realist artists, but in Close’s case the two dimensional
                documentation also made the subject’s face recognizable to him. Close’s portrait subjects are his
                friends, family members and the artist himself. The portraits are frontal, mugshot-like, with the
                figures looking straight at the camera/viewer, such as in the painting of <span
                    style="font-style: italic;">Phil</span> (Phillip Glass) [fig.1]. Most portraits lack a facial
                expression and the figures
                have a vacant look in their eyes.</p>

            <p>The first portraits Close drew in the 1960’s were exceptionally large – around 2X2.72m,
                and they were
                meant to be viewed from a close distance. They were created as a handwork reproduction
                of something that
                was created mechanically – not a painting of a face but of a photo of a face. Close
                created a precise
                copy of the photographs, including the focus of the camera lens and its shallow depth of
                field. The
                original photos were magnified by up to 50 times and exposed each skin pore, hairline,
                wrinkle and
                freckle.<a href="#fn7" class="endnote">[7]</a> In order to reach maximal precision Close
                used to divide
                the canvas into an orthogonal grid, and painted over it square after square using an
                airbrush.</p>
            <p>The first paintings in this technique were made in black and white. In the 70’s Close
                began creating
                color paintings in a technique simulating color prints - stacking layers of magenta,
                cyan and yellow one
                on top of the other – in order to create an effect of an enlarged photograph, as we can
                see with Mark [fig.2].
                The use of photography allowed Close to maintain an “objective” appearance of the
                figures.
                Objectification is reached by reducing the human face into an array of color stains
                placed in a certain
                order, with no hierarchy of detail information or treatment. The only hierarchy in the
                portraits is
                found in the nuances of the focal point, which is pre-determined by changes in the
                camera lens’s depth
                of field. Moreover, what intensifies the objectification is the impassive expression
                characteristic of
                the portraits. Gestalt is achieved, therefore, by reducing the subject into an objective
                category of an
                individual.

            <p>Close’s paintings present the human face much larger than in reality, and present every
                detail that might
                have gone unnoticed by the human eye. Therefore, they summon a prolonged observation of
                every minor
                detail, each pore becomes as important as a pupil or a nostril [fig.3]. In this manner a
                seemingly absolute
                gestalt is created – the ultimate reflection, the model of the face which is more than
                the face itself.
                In a way, the objectification of the human face only enhances the particularity of each
                portrait.
                Nonetheless, curator Robert Storr describes the portraits as ones in which “[a] person’s
                distinguishing
                traits are lost and found lost again”, and describes Close’s approach to the faces he
                paints as “a
                taxonomist studying a specimen”.<a href="#fn9" class="endnote">[9]</a></p>
            <p>Political scientist Jenny Edkins argues the photo-realism is the first step in
                dismantling the face and
                breaking gestalt. In his meticulous work, she argues, Close actually translates his face
                blindness into
                the canvas by undermining the viewer’s perception of the face in front of them. In the
                absence of
                overall gestalt of the face, the viewer is required to meticulously examine each and
                every detail of the
                portrait, to come near and step back from the portrait, in order to reassemble a
                coherent image of the
                face.<a href="#fn10" class="endnote">[10]</a></p>

                <span style="font-style: italic;">big Other</span> – which is the symbolic order, the
                place of all
                signifiers.<a href="#fn13" class="endnote">[13]</a> Yet, even in the early perceptual
                stage the
                otherness exists as something which comes from the individual. The <span
                    style="font-style: italic;">I</span> cannot exist a-priori, it needs be
                constituted first through the image of the self, and later by the image of the other.
                The imaginary is the gap between I and the image of I. Once the image becomes an
                integral part of
                self-identity, it is made an integral part of human life. This is the transition from
                the inner world to
                outer society. Here Lacan adds to Freud’s ego ideal the term ideal ego – the gap between
                the ideal I
                lead by the pleasure principal, and the real world which does not allow the ideal I to
                exist. As a
                result, Lacan argues that one cannot experience their selfhood but as determined by the
                outer world.<a href="#fn14" class="endnote">[14]</a> The subject constitutes themselves
                in their imaginary
                identification with the gaze of the other, for the gaze of the other. This is the
                fundamental turning
                point of the mirror-phase.
            </p>
            <p>Returning to Close, we can now see in the first stage of his work a somewhat figurative
                metaphor for
                Lacan’s imaginary identification. The face in the portrait is validated as an image of a
                subject through
                the viewer’s look, who recomposes the gestalt of the complete face. But it is not only
                the viewer who
                assumes the position of the Other, by also the photographic medium. Opposed to looking
                in a mirror, or
                looking at a painting which imitates a mirror reflection, with Close’s paintings the
                awareness to the
                Other is intensified because he’s duplicating a photograph. The perception of the I is
                constituted by an
                outer perception in itself. The photograph actively makes the Other’s view-point
                present, and presents
                reality as mediated by a <span style="font-style: italic;">big Other</span>, which
                incorporates the
                depicted self into the symbolic order.</p>
            <p class="article-sub">The Fragmented Face | Symbolic Identification</p>
            <p class="article-sub" style="text-indent: 1.5em;">1. Face-in-Pieces</p>
            <p>When an infant looks in the mirror they see their entire body for the first time, and can
                recognize it as
                themselves. The infant identifies with the figure reflected in the mirror as the “shape”
                of the ego, the
                <span style="font-style: italic;">I</span> receives a form and that is in fact the
                gestalt. The mirror
                symbolizes the reflection of a
                consolidated figure which creates the infant’s self-identity, first reflected by their
                parents and on by
                the social order.
            </p>
            <p>The infant is (justly) captivated by the relation between their actual body and its
                reflected image.
                Against that narcissist experience, when the infant has complete control over their
                reflection, arises
                the fantasy of the body-in-pieces or the fragmented body, described by Lacan as “a
                certain level of
                disintegration in the individual"<a href="#fn15" class="endnote">[15]</a>. The infant
                perceives their
                body as divided by their ontological existence and its image.</p>
            <p>Fragmentation is an inseparable part of Close’s work from the beginning. Close reduces
                the human face to
                a collection of supposedly arbitrary fragments, set in a specific composition. At first,
                the
                fragmentation was disguised by erasing/hiding the grid and creating a united figure.
                Later on, Close
                gradually intensified the fragmentation to the point where the fragments became
                independent objects.</p>
            <p>As mentioned, Close used to divide the canvas to a square grid. In his early works the
                grid was
                invisible, but in later works he chose to expose it, following different print
                techniques he had
                experimented with.<a href="#fn16" class="endnote">[16]</a> He also experimented with
                different grid
                sizes,
                in division to squares and dots, like in the portrait <span style="font-style: italic;">Robert</span>
                (Chuck Close, <span style="font-style: italic;">Robert/104,072</span>, 1973-74, Synthetic polymer paint
                and ink with graphite on gessoed canvas, 274.4 x 213.4 cm,
                Museum of Modern Art, New York, New York), composed of tiny black dots applied with a
                spray gun, each set inside a single square
                of a grid. There, one can notice the painting becoming more ‘grained’.
                Later on, the airbrush was replaced with fingerprints - as in the painting of <span
                    style="font-style: italic;">Fanny</span> [fig.4]. Eventually, the grid disappeared
                altogether and, in
                turn, was replaced with projecting photographs on the canvas.</p>

        <div class="article">
            <p>In the mid-1980’s the grid re-appeared in close’s portraits, but in a different way as a
                result of change
                in his work technique.<a href="#fn17" class="endnote">[17]</a> The canvas was divided
                into larger
                segments,
                and each segment was filled by colored x-s or circles. The large segments each had a
                multitude of
                colors and shapes. From a close look the depicted portrait of <span
                    style="font-style: italic;">Lucas</span> disintegrates into colorful fragments and
                becomes unrecognizable. Only by looking at the painting from a distance is the
                re-construction of
                the gestalt possible [fig.5,6]. Other alterations to the grid, such as uneven spacing,
                placing the grid
                diagonal to the canvas or using a radial grid like in <span style="font-style: italic;">Lucas II</span>
                (Chuck Close, Lucas II, 1987, Oil on
                canvas, 91.4 x 76.2 cm, Collection Jon and Mary Shirley), intensify the fragmentation.
                The face dissolves into
                the background, to the point that a full reconstruction is not always possible.
                Moreover, the figure
                on the canvas is dismantled to begin with, and Close serves it to the viewer in a manner
                which
                re-evokes the fantasy of the fragmented body.</p>

            <p>Unlike Close’s early works, where the viewer is captivated by the hyper objectification
                of the portraits,
                in his later works the portraits dissolve. By doing so, Close challenges the level of
                information needed
                to depict a portrait.<a href="#fn18" class="endnote">[18]</a> The viewer is left to
                reassemble the
                portrait, but the figure behind the portrait always remains lacking.</p>
            <p class="article-sub" style="text-indent: 1.5em;">2. Symbolic Identification and the
                Interpellation of the
                Subject</p>
            <p>If we could draw a parallel between the first stage of Close’s work and Lancan’s
                imaginary identification
                in the mirror stage, then the later stages of his work represent Lacan’s <span
                    style="font-style: italic;">symbolic identification</span>. In
                order to present the symbolic identification in Close’s portraits, we first need to
                elaborate several
                Lacanian concepts.</p>
            <p>The moment in which symbolic meaning is fixed is defined by Lacan as the <span
                    style="font-style: italic;">point de capiton</span> (nodal point) – the point at
                which the signifier
                and signified are quilted together.<a href="#fn19" class="endnote">[19]</a> The point de
                capiton has
                only a structural role, but holds no fixed meaning in itself. Therefore, the process of
                symbolization is
                contingent. Slavoj Žižek presents the formation of ideological space as an assembly of
                signifiers whose
                identity is not pre-determined, but sewn together into a fixed meaning in the process of
                ‘ideological
                quilting’.<a href="#fn20" class="endnote">[20]</a> For instance, Liberal ideology
                ‘quilts’ the
                neoclassical architectural style into public buildings that represent the republic, or
                the largest
                democracy in the world. Fascist ideology, on the other hand, ‘quilts’ Neoclassicism to
                buildings that
                represent subordination of the public to the leader.</p>
            <p>What determines an object’s identity then, beyond its descriptive qualities, is its
                ‘quilting’ into a
                certain ideological field. Žižek argues that the point de capiton is misconceived as a
                concentrated
                place of meaning, giving meaning to all other elements in the ideological field.
                Whereas, the point de
                capiton is the embodiment of a lack, a point of pure relativity perceived as identity.<a href="#fn21"
                    class="endnote">[21]</a></p>
            <p>The point de capiton marks the place of the big Other, it is the point through which the
                subject is
                ‘sewn’ to the signifier.<a href="#fn22" class="endnote">[22]</a> So what is symbolic
                identification,
                then? It is the subject’s identification with a certain signifying trait within the
                symbolic order.</p>
            <p>Imaginary identification is the identification with an image that represents who we would
                like to be –
                our <span style="font-style: italic;">ego ideal</span>; whereas symbolic identification
                is
                identification with the place from where we are seen,
                the place from where we observe ourselves – our <span style="font-style: italic;">ideal
                    ego</span>.<a href="#fn23" class="endnote">[23]</a> In the moment of symbolic
                identification the subject gains an
                autonomous self-identity, detached from the Other, by identifying with the Other.
                Symbolic
                identification <span style="text-decoration: underline;">constitutes</span> the
                imaginary
                identification, which in turn is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">constituted</span>. The
                interaction
                between the imaginary and symbolic identifications creates the mechanism that
                incorporates the subject
                into the socio-symbolic order, and thus ends the mirror-phase:</p>
        </div>
        <div class="quote">The moment in which the mirror-phase comes to an end inaugurates, by the
            identification with

                style="font-style: italic;">I</span> to socially elaborated

            <p>If we examine Close’s fragmented portraits as symbolic spaces, then we can regard the
                face as a rigid
                signifier that determines the identity of the various color patches and forms a united
                object. The color
                fields of the grid - whether they are round, square, exes of triangles – are actually
                ‘floating’
                signifiers devoid of meaning. Their identity as objects (ear, nose or eye, for instance)
                is set
                retroactively through the viewer’s gaze, which gives them a fixed meaning – that is, the
                gestalt of a
                subject.</p>
            <p>The viewer constitutes the face through symbolic identification with the portrait –
                identification with
                the symbolic order of the portrait space. The face painted in the portrait is
                constituted as an actual
                subject, through its interpellation into the symbolic order of the artwork [fig.7]. The
                viewer assembles the
                face in the portrait by identifying with the place from where they are looking at a
                fellow subject. What
                allows them to assemble the pieces of the picture into a gestalt of a figure is the same
                big Other with
                whom the identify; and simultaneously it is the place from where they are being watched
                themselves and
                constituted as a subject.</p>

                But in fact, it

            <p>The point de capiton is the point at which the individual is interpellated into a subject
                by the big
                Other. The big Other’s desire in relation to the subject is manifested in fantasy – an
                imaginary
                representation of fulfilling the desire. Fantasy defines the principals of desire, and
                at the same time,
                it is a structural framework through which we experience the world as consistent and
                meaningful.<a href="#fn26" class="endnote">[26]</a></p>
            <p>Can we regard Close’s grid as a fantastic structure? According to Edkins, the grid
                functions as a screen
                concealing the face and making it less recognizable. The face retreats behind the paint.
                What hides
                behind the screen is what resists representation. The figure behind the portrait always
                remains in its
                lack, and this inconsistency in the symbolic order is concealed by the structure of the
                grid. Adkins
                argues that “dismantling the face” means accepting that the signifying system—the social
                or symbolic
                order—is incomplete, itself structured around an impossibility.<a href="#fn27" class="endnote">[27]</a>
            </p>
            <p>Žižek defines ideology as a social fantasy “which is possible only on condition that the
                individuals
                partaking in it are not aware of its proper logic.”<a href="#fn28" class="endnote">[28]</a>
                The role of
                the fantasy is to paint a coherent picture of a homogeneous society, while there is no
                such society. The
                fantasy is not located in social theory but in material reality, in the form of an
                illusory structure.<a href="#fn29" class="endnote">[29]</a>
            </p>
            <p>On an individual level, this is the function of the grid in Close’s later portraits –
                attempting to
                create a coherent image of a subject, while the subject in the portraits exists only in
                its lack. Once
                we focus our attention on the grid structure, the fantasy dissolves.[fig.8]</p>

            <p>The last issue arising from the fantastic quality of the grid is the symptom. Symptom is
                a pathological
                failure in the symbolic system. The final stage in Lacanian analysis is identifying with
                the symptom –
                acknowledging it as an element that provides consistency in the subject’s being.<a href="#fn30"
                    class="endnote">[30]</a> In order to go beyond the social fantasy,
                Žižek offers to ‘identify with
                the social symptom’ – to acknowledge that the characteristics attributed to a socially
                abnormal object,
                are necessarily a product of the social structure itself.<a href="#fn31" class="endnote">[31]</a> The
                dismantled faces in Close’s portraits have
                also a symptomatic aspect. The fragmentation via the grid is a representation of a
                structured lack in
                the artwork’s symbolic space. In going through the symptom, we create a new symbolic
                reality, so that
                going through the fragmentation is what re-builds the face, as a result of the symbolic
                system which
                constitutes it.</p>
            <p class="article-sub">Conclusion</p>
            <p>This paper asked to draw the parallels between Close’s artistic work and Lacan’s
                Mirror-phase, as a stage
                in the formation of the <span style="font-style: italic;">I</span> and the
                representation of the <span style="font-style: italic;">I</span> as defined through the
                eyes of the other. Psychoanalyst Steven
                Mitchell presents a nice analogy between the work of the analyst and the portrait
                painter:</p>
        </div>
        <div class="quote">
            <p>The analyst becomes a kind of portrait painter of the patient’s experience, revealing the
                inner structure of that experience. The problem is that in painting their subjects,
                portrait painters also
                are expressing their own sensibility, their own subjectivity, and what they capture on
                canvas is partly the
                impact of their personality.
                <span class="endnote" style="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;"><a href="#fn32"
                        class="endnote">[32]</a></span>
            </p>
            <p>Artists, like psychoanalysts, have a great impact on what on what it is they are trying
                to understand, and there seems
                to be no way to factor out or analyze away that impact. There is no “me” awaiting to be
                captured, either by an artist or
                an analyst or even by myself.
                <span class="endnote" style="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;"><a href="#fn33"

        <div class="article" style="border-bottom:1px solid #103443;">
            If we consider Mitchell’s analogy via Lacanian categories, it is in fact a metaphor to the
            constitutive role of the
            other. The artist’s/analyst’s/other’s gaze is what constitutes the self. The artist’s or
            analyst’s function in relation
            to the subject or patient, is supposedly to elaborate their desires or pathologies, to
            outline their physiognomy and
            personality. But the portrait, or the reflection in the mirror for that matter, is not a
            mere documentation or
            extraction of the self It holds a constitutive role. “There is no ‘me’ awaiting to be
            captured“, but rather there is
            ‘me’ <span style="font-style: italic;">awaiting to be formed</span>.
