                art, design, architecture and theory.</p>
            <p>The atelier was originally
                founded in Tel Aviv by myself – Orly Even - a practicing artist and architect (allow me to continue in
                the first person&#9786). I hold a B.Arch degree in architecture (2010, Tel-Aviv Uni., <span
                    style="font-style: italic;">magna cum laude</span>) and
                a Master’s degree in history and philosophy of science and ideas (2016, Tel-Aviv Uni., <span
                    style="font-style: italic;">summa cum laude</span>). Over the past
                decade my main professional focus has been on architectural practice, and I have worked in top
                architecture firms in Tel
                Aviv (commercial, residential and public buildings), alongside with strong affiliation to the academy.
                Since 2015 I have also taught at the Faculty of Architecture and
                Town Planning at Technion Israel Institute of Technology (design-studios, workshops and architectural
                research
                courses), and have consulted and edited architectural-theoretical texts.
            </p>
            <p>Yet, this point in time has summoned a shift of focus to the arts, which have been my passion and a great
                interest of mine since
                early age. That is why <span style="font-style: italic;">Atelier Even</span> was covceived as a place of
                collaborative and interdisciplinary creation. The
                atelier is currently active in Tel Aviv and in Europe. It offers and welcomes creative collaborations in
                all fields of
                design (including web), art and architecture, as well as editorial services and open exchanges of
                original ideas.</p>

            <p>This websites features the atelier's selection of written and visual works, divided into “galleries”.
                Full architectural and artist
                portfolio are also available upon request.</p>
